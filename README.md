Hello Friends👋

I'm excited to share a recent project where I challenged myself to design and develop a website using React and Tailwind CSS. 

For this project, I focused on: <br/>
✔️Custom Implementation: Avoid using many pre-built components and implementing most of logic and functionality independently. <br/>
✔️Responsiveness: Ensuring the website looks and works great on all devices. <br/>
✔️Dark Mode Toggle: It's possible to toggle between dark and light mode and show appropriate design for each mode. <br/>
